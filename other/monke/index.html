    <h1>Random Character Generator</h1>
    
    <p style="padding-left: 15px;"><em>Inspired by the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/infinite_monkey_theorem"> infinite monkey theorem</a> and book "The Library of Babel" by Jorge Luis Borges - Written by Samuel (Big Smoke) Birhanu</em></p>
    <hr>
    <div  class="alert alert-light" role="alert">
       Note: It does not use the terms used in the theorem - nor the concept of the book. This generator uses Vannila JS' own random Number function.
      </div>
      <hr>
      <h2>How it works:</h2>
      <!-- <p >There are two functions: A simple random number generator that takes a minimum and a maximum value as its argument and returns a value between them - and a function that takes the value one by one and outputs it into text character. </p> -->
      <!-- <hr> -->
      <h4>The Random Number Generator</h4>
    
        <div class="code">
            <code style="white-space: pre-line;">  function randomBetween(min, max) {
                    return Math.floor(Math.random() * (max - min + 1) + min);
                   }
            </code>
            <div class="code-desc">
                <p>What it does is that it takes 2 arguments - named min and max. And it returns a random number between those two arguments. By default, 
                the <span style="color: aqua;" class="font-monospace">Math.random()</span> method returns a number between 0 and 1. 
                </p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <p>This is simple as it gets. According to the tutorial eBook on Javascript created from Free Stack Overflow Contributors, the <span style="color: aqua;" class="font-monospace">Math.random()</span> is considered unrealistic when it comes to its results. The reason being that the random values tend to have a standard deviation approaching 0. In reality, randomness tends to gather around a common value instead of 0.  If plotted on a graph, it should show a bell curve (Gaussian Distributon). So the inbuilt method doesn't show the "randomness" it claims it has.<br>
        The solution to this - according to the eBook, is this:
        </p>
        <code style="white-space: pre-line;">var randNum = (Math.random() + Math.random()) / 2;
            var randNum = (Math.random() + Math.random() + Math.random()) / 3;
            var randNum = (Math.random() + Math.random() + Math.random() + Math.random()) / 4; //... do it 4 or 5 times
        </code>
        <p>Or a less messy one:
        </p>
        <code style="white-space: pre-line;">// v is the number of times random is summed and should be over >= 1
            // return a random number between 0-1 exclusive
            function randomG(v){
             var r = 0;
             for(var i = v; i > 0; i --){
                r += Math.random();
                }
                return r / v;
               }                                
        </code>
        <p>But this has its own problem. Since it gathers around a common value, it doesn't give you a varied value when you re-work it and give it some boundaries to find a random value from. for 100 - or even - 1000 iterations, you can see the random value clustered around a given value. We can't use this.</p>

        <br>
        <p>The best canidate is the simple function that takes the boundary arguments.</p>

        <h4>Character Set</h4>
        <p>The Character Set contains the 26 lowercase alphabet letters , a comma , a period and a space - simmilar to the one used in "The Library of Babel." In the future, I plan of implementing the Geez alphabet.
        
        </p>

        <p>
            How the RNG and the character set communicate is fairly easy. Javascript has an inbuilt function that takes a character from a string and returns its ASCII value. So I wrote the 26 letters and the punctuation marks(space incuded) and output their ASCII values. then, I pushed each value into an empty array. So when every time the RNG returns a random value, it checks whether it belongs to the ASCII value array and converts them into a text character. Those converted text characters are pushed into a new array and their concatenated string values are displayed. If you do this recursively 10 or 100 times, you'll get more random characters concatenated on top of the previous one.
